## üöÄ Getting Started: Set Up & Run

Follow these steps to get the AI Scrum Master Agent up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9+
* `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/AI-Scrum-Master-Agent.git](https://github.com/your-username/AI-Scrum-Master-Agent.git)
    cd AI-Scrum-Master-Agent
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended for dependency isolation):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    Create a `requirements.txt` file in your project root with the following content:
    ```
    streamlit
    google-generativeai
    pandas
    plotly
    langchain
    ```
    Then, install them:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Configuration

1.  **Set your Google API Key:**
    The application requires a Google API Key to access the Gemini 2.0 Flash model. Obtain yours from the [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/).

    Set it as an environment variable (replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual key):
    ```bash
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    (On Windows Command Prompt: `set GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` | On PowerShell: `$env:GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"`)

    *The app will display an error in the sidebar if the API key is not found.*

### Running the Application

1.  **Launch the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run scrum_agent_v1.py
    ```

    The application will automatically open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.
